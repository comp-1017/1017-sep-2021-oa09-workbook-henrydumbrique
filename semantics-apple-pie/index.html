            <h2>Choosing the best apple for pies</h2>
            <p>So what is the best apple for apple pie? Well this question can start a fight in any kitchen. So you want a tart and tangy apple with a firm flesh. Maybe you like a splash of sweetness or maybe a firm fleshy apple is more to your liking. When it comes to choosing your apple for Grandmas apple pie we recommend using Granny Smith, Honeycrisp or Mutsu</p>
            <dl>
                <dt>Granny Smith Apples</dt>
                <dd>Granny Smith apples are generally thought of as the go-to baking apple, but in the BA test kitchen, we have a few favorites that hold up under heat and balance sweet-tart flavor. Try them when youâ€™re ready to branch out.</dd>
                <dt>Honey Crisp Apples</dt>
                <dd>Honeycrisp is our desert-island apple. Its shatteringly crisp texture is guaranteed to hold firm when baked or caramelized, such as in our Apple-Molasses Upside-Down Cake or an elegant Tarte tatin.</dd>
                <dt>Mutsu (aka. Crispin)</dt>
                <dd>Mutsu also known as Crispin, this firm-fleshed, less tart option is similar in flavor to a Golden Delicious. Great for pies or other recipes that call for gentle cooking.</dd>
